Uncertainty quantification - in brain MRI images using Bayesian CNN.

Introduction :
Jupyter notebook walks through building probablistic deep learning models. These models incorporate a distribution into the model architecture using 
Tensorflow probability.
As an example we will analyze and build a probabilistic deep learning model to classify brain tumors using MRI images(training dataset is from Kaggle).
The main advantage for applying a probablistic approach to deep learning is that it provides a means for dealing with the uncertainty involved in the modeling process. This is very important for critical application where there is a high penalty for an inaccurate prediction, such as medical diagnoses.

Data: 
Brain MRI images from Kaggle. Added red noise to these images to analyze the probabilistic prediction made by models.
